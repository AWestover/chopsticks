This is a project where we attempt to make a cool chopsticks player

Outline:
v1 - basic player strategy copying
v1.5 - v1 with i/o from voice and microphone
v2 - genetic strategy updating

v3 - v1.5 with mod n
v4 - genetic mod n


Conventions:


A state is an array with 
state = [ player_hand1, player_hand2, enemy_hand1, enemy_hand2 ]
Note different players will observe this differently
